## Problem Statement
Nowadays, traffic inside the campus has increased due to the hassle of four-wheeler vehicles. The increased traffic delays the work of people running on time. So usually, people park their vehicles in any undesirable slot blocking the road, which can cause unwanted traffic accidents. The parking slots are not well used. The mismanagement of parking slots in cities has increased traffic and is causing unwanted parking on the roads. People tend to spend a lot of time searching for empty parking slots, and so to save their time, they park haphazardly, which creates problems for others and, in turn, cages other cars.

For example, public malls are often crowded with vehicles all around them because people are unaware of the availability of parking slots, thus creating traffic and problems for others. Also in public places, there is rarely a parking place and vehicles can't be parked on the roadsides, so it is difficult for the drivers to find a suitable place to park.

## Our Idea
Smart Car Parking System
Considering the before mentioned problem statement, we decided to build a webapp SLIDe which will help to manage parking slots and save everyoneâ€™s time.
SLIDe is a web-app, designed for companies as well as drivers to minimize the hassle caused because of improper management of parking spaces.

Our web application ties up with public parking spots vendors to digitalize and decrease the manpower for managing them. In the dashboard, they can see the total number of parking slots in that location and also the number of filled and empty parking slots. As soon as any vehicle enters their checking point, it's number plate will be captured and the vehicle number is recognized using the ML model and stored in the database. 

The users can login and check the availability of parking slots near their selected destination and plan out their events accordingly , thus saving their time and minimizing parking traffic and hassle.

## Novelty
- Our idea is basically to create a webapp that can be used by companies to manage their parking slots and by vehicle owners to view the empty parking spaces nearest to their chosen destination.
- They can check the availability of parking slots beforehand and even pre book a slot for 30 minutes, just as simple as booking an Ola ride. 
- In public places, the user will be able to see all the nearest parking places so that he can choose according to his convenience.
- For the company's perspective, the vehicle's number can be detected using ML at the check-in gate, and by this, the dashboard will be updated every time a vehicle enters or leaves the slot. 
- Implementation of IOT can further minimize the use of cameras and other heavy files, and can make the tracking of vehicles easier.

## How it works
SLIDe is an intelligent parking system that assists drivers in finding a parking space. 

We have created two register portals and one login portal one for user and one for the administrator. The administrator can view their parking slots, the empty and the vacant slots which can also be seen by the user if they enter location in their website. Then we also allow a user to pre-book a slot for a period of time so that they save time . The unregistered users are alloted a parking slot when they move inside the place where the camera detects their Number Plate and allocates a free slot marked with their number.

If there are no parking slots left in the desired location ,our website scans through minimum radius from where it can fetch the free slot and again till it finds the nearest parking slot from the location the user chose.
